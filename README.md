# Greenhouse gas fluxes across three grassland soil/cover types under a redox manipulation 

## Study Plan: Soil Activity and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
## Sabra Moen and Allison Wallin (Spring 2022)

We are looking to determine the effects of added organic carbon from a litter source in anaerobic and aerobic conditions with the corresponding microbial metabolism and what the resulting production of greenhouse gas emissions in urban soils (prairie, turf, fallow compost) are.
